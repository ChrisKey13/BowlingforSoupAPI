# Bowling API

Welcome to the Bowling API project! This Ruby on Rails API is designed to manage bowling game data, including players, teams, and scores. It offers a variety of features such as search functionality, autocomplete for search queries, and faceted filtering to refine search results.

## Features

- **Search**: Allows users to search for teams or players using a variety of parameters.
- **Autocomplete**: Offers autocomplete suggestions for search queries to improve user experience.
- **Faceted Search/Filtering**: Enables users to narrow down search results based on specific criteria like team names or score ranges.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Bowling API, you'll need to have Ruby on Rails installed on your system. Follow these steps to install and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bowling-api.git
   cd bowling-api
   ```

2. **Bundle install:**

   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. **Database setup:**

   ```bash
   rails db:create db:migrate
   ```

4. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   rails server
   ```

The API should now be running on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Usage

Here are some example requests you can make to interact with the API:

- **Search for teams or players:**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/search?query=Team+Name"
  ```

- **Get autocomplete suggestions:**

  ```bash
  curl -X GET "http://localhost:3000/autocomplete?query=Alph"
  ```

More detailed API documentation will be provided as the project evolves.
